## Description
This is generic code I've reused in certain projects.

## Usage in Eclipse
Follow the instructions this project can be added to the build path of another Eclipse project.

First configure this project correctly if hasn't already been configured:
1. Add this project as a Java project in Eclipse.
2. Right-click on this project, then go to "Properties".
3. In the Properties screen, select libraries.
4. The only library that should be there is the android.jar corresponding to the API level you want to support. e.g. \android-sdk-windows\platforms\android-7\android.jar
5. You can add this jar by clicking on "Add External JARs".

Next, add this project to the build path of another Eclipse project:
1. Right click on that project, then go to "Properties".
2. Select the "Projects" tab, click on add, then add this project.
